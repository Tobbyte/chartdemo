# chartdemo

workaround for making the chart zoomable and placing the (bottom) titles above the chart to be able to show whatever additional data.

It's not the most elegant solution, but maybe it can help someone else out there.
bases on older solutions of @theovogel  [here](https://github.com/imaNNeo/fl_chart/issues/71#issuecomment-1414267612) and @techhouse [here](https://github.com/imaNNeo/fl_chart/issues/776#issuecomment-1212109108)

minimal demo: [repo](https://github.com/Tobbyte/chartdemo/blob/main/lib/main.dart)

I use this to display week ticks across the chart, like so.
